The Eaton lab is happy to welcome two new members: **Jared Meek** and 
**Guo Cen**. Jared is a new M.A. student interested in plant systematics and conservation. Before even starting in the E3B program he already joined 
our field expedition this summer to the Hengduan Mountains, and so he is 
hitting the ground running with tons of data in hand to study phylogeography 
in *Pedicularis*. Guo Cen is a visiting Ph.D. student from the Chinese Academy of Sciences graduate program at the Kunming Institute of Botany, and was awarded
a fellowship to study internationally. She is investigating the phylogeny and diversification of temperate 
bamboo species.
