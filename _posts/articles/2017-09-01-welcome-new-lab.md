<p>
The Eaton lab is happy to welcome its first two members to the lab!
Patrick McKenzie is a new Ph.D. student joining us from the University of Tennessee, and 
is supported by a prestigious <i>NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP)</i>.
Patrick is interested in plant phylogenetics, bioinformatics, and 
machine learning. Sandra Hoffberg also joined the lab this fall as 
new Postdoctoral Fellow. Sandra completed her Ph.D. at the
University of Georgia in 2017 and came to Columbia with an <i>NSF Postdoctoral
Fellowship in Plant Genomes</i>. She is interested in the development of 
molecular genotyping methods, bioinformatics, and their use in agriculture.
