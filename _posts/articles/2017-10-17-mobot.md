<!--h1 class="entry-subtitle"> Eaton-lab visits the Missouri Botanic Garden </h1-->

<p>
The Eaton lab had their first group venture out of the city this weekend to visit
the Missouri Botanic Garden for the 64th Annual Fall Symposium. Deren gave one 
of the invited lectures on <i>Parallel evolution in neotropical Viburnum</i>, and Sandra and Patrick 
presented posters on <i>Amaranthus deep population sequencing</i> and <i>phylogenetic 
invariants-based tests for detecting admixture</i>, respectively.

The lineup of speakers this year was really fantastic and we all learned a lot. 
And we got great feedback on many of our ongoing projects.
The meeting had a great turn out from all over the region, and it was really
fun catching up with everyone. 
Hopefully next visit we'll have more time to tour the botanic garden as well.
