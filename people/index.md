<span style="font-weight:bold">Deren Eaton</span> ([de2356@columbia.edu](mailto:de2356@columbia.edu)) is an Assistant 
Professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology
(E3B) at Columbia University. 
He is an evolutionary biologist and botanist with broad interests 
in plant biodiversity -- from the scale of global patterns and community 
assembly, to speciation and genetic variation within species. 
Deren's research is rooted in organismal biology and fieldwork, 
with projects focused in the Tibetan plateau and cloud forests of 
Central and South America. A common theme across his work
is the development of new computational or statistical methods 
for analyzing comparative data, and the implementation and 
support for reproducible science. Deren completed a 
postdoc at Yale in 2017; earned his PhD from the University
of Chicago in 2014; and his BSc from the University of Minnesota in 
2007.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Sandra Hoffberg</span> ([slh2181@columbia.edu](mailto:slh2181@columbia.edu)) joined the lab
in 2017 as an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow.
Sandra's work is focused on the development of tools and resources to 
expedite large-scale genotyping and bioinformatic analyses of 
germplasm databases (i.e., seed databases) for agriculture and 
plant breeding research. Her work combines genomics, phylogenetics, 
and functional trait evolution to study invasiveness and 
herbicide resistance. Sandra completed her PhD in 2017 at the 
University of Georgia where she studied <i>Wisteria</i> and 
<i>Kudzu</i> and worked on the development of new genomic library protocols 
3RAD and RADcap.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Patrick McKenzie</span>
([pfm2119@columbia.edu](mailto:pfm2119@columbia.edu))
joined the lab in 2017 and was a recipient of an NSF Graduate Research 
Fellowship (GRFP). Patrick's PhD thesis research will investigate phylogeny, 
introgression, and floral evolution in <i>Monarda</i> and <i>Pedicularis</i>, 
and involves developing new machine learning inference methods. 
He completed his Bachelors degree at the University of Tennessee.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Jared Meek</span> 
([jared.meek@columbia.edu](mailto:jared.meek@columbia.edu))
joined the lab in 2018 and is interested in plant biodiversity, 
phylogenetics, and conservation. His thesis research is focused on 
developing comparative phylogeographic methods for comparing contemporary 
and historical plant collections to detect recent human mediated gene flow 
in the Hengduan Mountains. He completed his Bachelors degree at Brigham 
Young University.

<span style="font-weight:bold">I'm looking to recruit</span> talented
post-docs and student to work on independent projects and/or to join 
on-going projects in the lab. If interested please contact Deren, 
especially if you are interested in pursuing fellowship proposals for the 
coming year. Many opportunities are available, including NSF graduate and 
postdoctoral fellowships, and internal Columbia fellowships.
