The Eaton lab is currently looking to recruit motivated post-docs, Ph.D,
Masters, and undergraduate students. If you are interested in joining the lab
please see the section below titled [joining the lab](#joining-the-lab).

### PI: Deren Eaton

I earned my undergraduate degree at the University of Minnesota where I studied
plant eco-physiology in Jeannine Cavender-Bares' lab. After graduating I worked
for a year with Annie Schmitt's lab at Brown University. I then completed my
Ph.D. at the University of Chicago where I studied genomics and phylogenetics
with my major adviser Rick Ree at the Field Museum. I then went on to do a
postdoc in Michael Donoghue's lab at Yale University
before finally starting in E3B at Columbia in the summer of 2017.

### Post-docs
... coming soon.
<!-- Sandra Hoffberg will be joining the lab this fall as an NSF-funded post-doc
to work on developing large-scale genotyping and bioinformatic methods for
studying plant germplasm databases. Sandra comes to us from the Mauricio lab
at the University of Georgia where she studied fine-scale phylogeography of
invasive plant species including *Wisteria*, and developed the hybrid RAD-seq
and sequence capture approach RADcap. -->


### Graduate Students
... coming soon.
<!-- Patrick McKenzie will be joining the lab this fall as an incoming Ph.D. student.
Patrick is joining us from the University of Tennessee where he recently completed
his undergraduate degree.

### Joining the lab:

##### Postdocs
I'm currently looking to recruit postdocs to work on independent projects in
the lab and/or to join ongoing projects. I encourage people to contact me about
writing proposals for the coming year for available postdoc fellowships.
Some great resources to find fellowships are available
[here](http://mathbionerd.blogspot.com/2014/04/some-postdoctoral-fellowships-in-biology.html)
and [here](http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/dl384/Resources_Postdocs.html).
Please email me with your CV if you'd like to discuss
fellowship opportunities.
