<span style="font-weight:bold">Deren Eaton</span>

([de2356@columbia.edu](mailto:de2356@columbia.edu)) is an Assistant 
Professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology
(E3B) at Columbia University. 
He is an evolutionary biologist and botanist with broad interests 
in plant biodiversity -- from the scale of global patterns and community 
assembly, to speciation and genetic variation within species. 
Deren's research is rooted in organismal biology and fieldwork, 
with projects focused in the Tibetan plateau and cloud forests of 
Central and South America. A common theme across his work
is the development of new computational or statistical methods 
for analyzing comparative data, and the implementation and 
support for reproducible science. Deren completed a 
postdoc at Yale in 2017; earned his PhD from the University
of Chicago in 2014; and his BSc from the University of Minnesota in 
2007.
