<span style="font-weight:bold">Deren Eaton</span>
 ([de2356@columbia.edu](mailto:de2356@columbia.edu)) is an Assistant 
Professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology
(E3B) at Columbia University. 
He is an evolutionary biologist and botanist with broad interests 
in plant biodiversity -- from the scale of global patterns and community 
assembly, to speciation and genetic variation within species. 
Deren's research is rooted in organismal biology and fieldwork, 
with projects focused in the Tibetan plateau and cloud forests of 
Central and South America. A common theme across his work
is the development of new computational or statistical methods 
for analyzing comparative data, and the implementation and 
support for reproducible science. Deren completed a 
postdoc at Yale in 2017; earned his PhD from the University
of Chicago in 2014; and his BSc from the University of Minnesota in 
2007.

Sandra Hoffberg</span> ([slh2181@columbia.edu](mailto:slh2181@columbia.edu)) joined the lab
in 2017 as an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow. Sandra's work focuses the development 
of genomic tools to expedite large-scale genotyping and bioinformatic 
analyses. Currently, her work is focused on the agriculturally important plant
clade <i>Amaranthus</i>, where she is using genomics to study phylogenetic 
history, introgression, herbicide resistance, and speciation. 
Sandra completed her PhD in 2017 at the 
University of Georgia where she studied <i>Wisteria</i> and 
<i>Kudzu</i> and worked on the development of new genomic library protocols 
3RAD and RADcap.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Carlos Alonso Maya Lastra</span> ([cam2384@columbia.edu](mailto:cam2384@columbia.edu)) joined the lab
in 2019 as an Postdoctoral Researcher. Carlos is a computational biologist, 
botanist, and systematist. His research interests include Euphorbiaceae 
phylogeny and systematics of <i>Cnidoscolus</i> (More info: 
[http://camayal.info/](http://camayal.info/)). He is working in the Eaton 
lab to investigate phylogeny and introgression in <i>Viburnum</i> using genomic 
RAD-seq data, and on modeling speciation and gene flow of wild and 
domesticated crop species using forward-in-time simulations. Carlos 
completed his PhD in 2018 from the Institute of Ecology in Xalapa, Mexico.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Jianjun Jin</span> 
([jj3111@columbia.edu](mailto:jj3111@columbia.edu)) joined the lab
in 2020 as an Postdoctoral Researcher. Jianjun is a computational biologist and 
plant systematist interested in the development new software tools for 
phylogenetics and genome assembly. His software tools GetOrganelle has become
widely used for plastome and mitogenome assemblies. He is working in the Eaton 
lab to assemble a reference genome of <i>Pedicularis</i>, perform comparative
studies of floral gene expression, and to develop new bioinformatic tools. Jianjun
completed his PhD at the Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of 
Sciences.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Patrick McKenzie</span>
([pfm2119@columbia.edu](mailto:pfm2119@columbia.edu))
joined the lab in 2017 and was a recipient of an NSF Graduate Research 
Fellowship (GRFP). Patrick's PhD research involves the development of new
methods for inferring phylogenies and networks from SNP data. He is working on 
phylogeographic and systematic studies of Chinese <i>Pedicularis</i> and 
North American <i>Monarda</i>. 
He completed his Bachelors degree at the University of Tennessee.

([jared.meek@columbia.edu](mailto:jared.meek@columbia.edu))
joined the lab in 2018 and is interested in plant biodiversity, 
phylogenetics, and conservation. Jared's research is focused on 
developing comparative phylogeographic methods for comparing contemporary 
and historical plant collections to detect recent human mediated gene flow 
in the Hengduan Mountains. He completed his Bachelors degree at Brigham 
Young University.
