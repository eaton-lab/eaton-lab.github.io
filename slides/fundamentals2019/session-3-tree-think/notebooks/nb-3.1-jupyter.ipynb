    "The Jupyter Notebook is a powerful tool for interactively developing and presenting data science projects. It allows you to use a web browser (as opposed to a terminal or other software) to interact with a computer language interpreter (typically Python) to send commands and receive outputs. It then displays the outputs in HTML below the executed cells, and allows users to add rich text comments or annotations around code cells using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). "

This cell is set up to execute a type of code called *Markdown*, which is a language for formatting text, much like HTML (which is called a *MarkUp* language). Markdown is much easier to learn than HTML, and for that reason has become a very popular tool for simple formatting and styling of text. To transform the cell back into *rendered text* you must *execute it*, which can be done by pressing the 'Run' button in the notebook tool bar while the cell is selected, or, by **holding down the control key and pressing enter**. We recommend that you learn the hotkey commands, since it will make you a more efficient notebook user. You can click on the keyboard icon in the toolbar to find a list of hotkey commands, or find many resources online ([like this one](https://towardsdatascience.com/jypyter-notebook-shortcuts-bf0101a98330)).
